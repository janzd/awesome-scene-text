# Awesome Scene Text
A curated list of papers and resources for scene text detection and recognition

The year when a paper was first published, including ArXiv publications, is used. As a result, there may be cases when a paper was accepted for example to CVPR 2019, but it is listed in year 2018 because it was published in 2018 on ArXiv.
